To avoid conflicts when merging, it would be effective to do a `git pull origin main` once we know the last person has merged their changes into the main branch.  In cases like this, communication is a must!  The exercise taught us how to handle conflicts when merging.  It appears that sometimes these conflicts will be unavoidable as we will be working on multiple branches at the same time.  Overall, it was a great fun exercise.
